# Analysis of critical transitions at the Global Forest


the idea is to do a global analysis using early warning signals of ecological transitions [@Kefi2014] 


Thus the question is how near/far is the global forest from a catastrophic transition?

We will use the MODIS vegetation continuous field, so we can analyze temporal changes.

* Hypothesis: two power laws, small patches related to deforestation dynamics, large patches related to forest inner dynamics.

# Methods

* The United Nationsâ€™ International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme definition of forest (Belward 1996) defined forest as pixels with tree cover equal or greater than 30%  

* We should define areas with different levels of degradation to apply the spatial indicators [Very difficult because is not possible to establish reliable controls]

* We should use 2D DFT and multifractals in continuous data and fit patch size distributions in discretized data.[Not implemented] 

* Rates of growth an shrink of patches [@Manor2008a, @Manor2008] 

* Portfolio concept relating [@Manor2008a]  and [@Schindler2015]

Table: Model selection using Akaike criterion


![Power law exponent by year and with different starting point: xmin=1 the minimun patchs size was fixed at 1, *Estimated Xmin* the minimun patch size was estimated from data.](Results/Southamerica/PowerExp_xmin_year.png)

* The $\alpha$ with Estimated Xmin correspond to big forest patches and natural forest dynamics, and there is no variation in these. The  $\alpha$ with xmin=1 correspond to small patches probably influenced by deforestation.
