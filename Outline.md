# Analysis of critical transitions at the Global Forest


the idea is to do a global analysis using early warning signals of ecological transitions [@Kefi2014] 


Thus the question is how near/far is the global forest from a catastrophic transition?

We will use the MODIS vegetation continuous field, so we can analyze temporal changes.


# Methods

* The United Nationsâ€™ International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme definition of forest (Belward 1996) defined forest as pixels with tree cover equal or greater than 30%  

* We should define areas with different levels of degradation to apply the spatial indicators 

* We should use 2D DFT and multifractals in continuous data and fit patch size distributions in discretized data. 

* Rates of growth an shrink of patches [@Manor2008a, @Manor2008]
