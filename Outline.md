# Analysis of critical transitions at the Global Forest

the idea is to do a global analysis using the techniques of the kind given in
[@Kefi2014] this includes for example analysis of patch size distributions, and/or how the patches
grow and shrink.


Thus the question is how near/far is the global forest from a catastrophic transition?

The data could be the Joe Sexton's "Landsat-based rescaling of MODIS vegetation continuous field" that has landsat resolution or maybe only the MODIS vegetation continuous field, because it has more temporal resolution. 

The first topics for discussion are:

1. VCF data is continuous so how to define forest patches
2. Techniques that for continuous data as bidimensional spectral
analysis could be applied also
3. Different global areas should be defined like: boreal forest,
tropical forest... or the analysis could be done by continents, or by
level of degradation...
