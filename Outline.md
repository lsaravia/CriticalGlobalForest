# Analysis of critical transitions at the Global Forest


The idea is to do a global analysis using insights from percolation theory to detect signals of ecological transitions [@Kefi2014] 


Thus the question is how near/far is the global forest from a catastrophic transition?

We will use the MODIS vegetation continuous field, so we can analyse temporal changes.


* Most probably multiple process influence the distributions of patch size at a continental scale, so we are trying to extract the main generic ones.

* How scaling laws are related to ecosystem function?

* Hypothesis: two power laws, small patches related to deforestation dynamics, large patches related to forest inner dynamics.


# Methods

* The United Nationsâ€™ International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme definition of forest (Belward 1996) defined forest as pixels with tree cover equal or greater than 30%  

* We should define areas with different levels of degradation to apply the spatial indicators [Very difficult because is not possible to establish reliable controls]

* The distribution of patches is continuous but the data is discretized so we discard the lowest values and start fitting patch sizes greater than 10.


* MODIS VCF

* Fitting four models

* Consecuences of each model

* Rates of growth an shrink of patches [@Manor2008a, @Manor2008] 

* Portfolio concept relating [@Manor2008a]  and [@Schindler2015]

## Results






![Power law exponent of best models by year and with different data sets: **<Xmin* the data is less than the extimated minimum patch size, *Estimated Xmin* the minimum patch size was estimated from data, and only patch sizes greater than or equal to Xmin was used.](figure/PowerExp_Xmin_year.png)
