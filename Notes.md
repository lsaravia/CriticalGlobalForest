Science search for universal principles [@Marquet2005; @Harte2014], and one of these universal principles are scaling laws, These scaling laws are a of the nonequilibrium conditions under which structures at different levels are created and how large-scale patterns are generated from local interactions.

Power laws are asociated with two properties: scale invariance and universality [@Marquet2005]

Most patterns in biological and ecological systems are produced by the agregation of many small processes, thus the logical expectation is that they result in a Gaussian probability distribution according to the central limit theorem [@Frank2009]. Thus the finding that patch distribution follows a scale-free power law distribution is surprising, if the small scale process are in fact correlated we also obtain a Gausian distribution, so we need more than correlation to obtain the scale free distribution.

[@Haddad2015] Habitat fragmentation and its lasting impact on Earth’s ecosystems

New satellite data sets reveal at high resolution how human activities
are transforming global ecosystems. Foremost among these observations
are those of forest cover because of the high contrast between forest
and anthropogenic land cover types. Deforestation, which was already
widespread in temperate regions in the mid-18th to 20th centuries
and increased in the tropics over the past half century, has resulted
in the loss of more than a third of all forest cover worldwide (10, 11).


##  Fragmentation Analysis – Global 

The global distance-to-edge map and histogram (Figure 1A, B) were generated from a global, 30-m resolution raster dataset of percent tree cover for the year 2000 (Sexton et al. 2013). Pixels covered with clouds or shadows in 2000 were filled with values from the same dataset in 2005, and those obscured by clouds or shadows in both 2000 and 2005 were filled with values from the MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover layer for the year 2000 (DiMiceli et al. 2011). Following the United Nations’ International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme definition of forest (Belward 1996), tree-cover values were converted from percentages to binary forest/non-forest cover by applying a threshold of 30% cover: pixels with tree cover less than 30% were labeled “non-forest”, and those with tree cover greater than or equal to 30% were labeled “forest”. A minimum mapping unit (MMU) filter was then applied to the binary map, re-coding the values of any contiguous group of pixels—whether forest or non-forest—whose combined area was less than one hectare to that of the surrounding pixels. The resulting 30-m resolution binary raster of forest vs. non-forest cover with MMU of 1 ha was then coarsened to 90-m resolution using a majority rule.

The area of Earth’s land surface devoted to cropland already occupies 1.53 billion hectares (83) and may expand 18% by the middle of this century (84), and the area committed to urban centers is predicted to triple to 0.18 billion hectares by 2030 (85)

@Weerman2012 Changes in diatom patch-size distribution and degradation in a spatially self-organized intertidal mudflat ecosystem

we used a cumulative distribution in which no binning is used. The patch-size distributions were fitted using the following equation describing an upper-truncated cumulative number-size distribution based on a power law (Burroughs and Tebbens 2001):


where M(r) is the cumulative fitting function of patches
of size r (in cm2), C is a constant, c is the scaling

A recent paper of Pueyo (2011) showed that, for
fundamental reasons, we should move away from the
power law vs. truncated power law dichotomy to other
categorizations. More precisely, a truncated power law
can be fitted to all the data sets (if taken at a large
enough scale) and we expect that truncation becomes
stronger when a dryland approaches degradation
(following similar reasoning as Kefi et al. [2007]). In
line with this, all our patch-size distributions were fitted
using Eq. 1. To evaluate the degree of the truncation of
the curves, we defined the observed truncation to be th



The loss of cover fraction of vegetation, or of other
organisms, is the most direct way to assess the degree of
deterioration of ecosystems (Reynolds et al. 2007,
Maestre and Escudero 2009, 2010). However, ecosys-
tems with strong feedback mechanisms can respond
nonlinearly, involving tipping points, to gradually
increased stress (Rietkerk et al. 2004, Scheffer et al.
2009). In those cases, the cover fraction at which a
tipping point occurs is unknown, and cover fraction
alone is not sufficient to indicate the proximity of a
tipping point in the ecosystem (Kefi et al. 2010).

The number of H. prunifolius clusters of area s, n(s), is
presented in figure 2 on a double-logarithmic scale. The
distribution is clearly fat-tailed, and the large s tail resem-
bles a straight line, apparently reflecting a power law. It
deviates strongly from the Poisson forest limit, which has
an exponential cutoff at large s.

# Motion detection algorithm
To test the relevance of spatial heterogeneity, we tracked
clusters over time, using a simple motion-detection al-
gorithm (see fig. 3A). We identified all of the clusters in
two consecutive censuses and checked, for any cluster in
the latter census, whether it had at least one colored square
in common with a cluster in the former census. If there
was such a square, the latter cluster was assigned the same
index number as the former, so that they were considered
two instances of the same cluster. If there was no such
overlap, the latter cluster was designated as new. If a cluster
had split between one census and the next, the larger piece
kept the index number of the original cluster, and the
smaller one was considered new. When two clusters
merged, the merged cluster was assigned the same index
as the larger of the two original clusters.


If spatial heterogeneity is strong, then large patches have
to be associated with favored spatial locations, while the
small clusters, like the singletons, will appear in the non-
favored regions. In such a case, the response to spatially
uniform stress varies with cluster size. We implemented a
motion-tracking algorithm in order to follow the dynamics
of the cluster over time (see fig. 3). This allowed the ex-
traction of the per capita birth/death rate from the dif-
ferences between consecutive censuses, which was then
plotted against the patch size in figure 3B. The result is
independent of size (up to the noise that reflects the rel-
ative rarity of large patches), suggesting that a patch of
size s shrinks or grows by a number proportional to s
(multiplicative random walk; see Manor and Shnerb
2008a, 2008b).

As further evidence against the niche assembly hypoth-
esis, we measured the average displacement of the center
of mass of patches as a function of time. The movement
of the patches appears similar to a simple random walk
(fig. 4), because Dr, the distance of the center of mass from
its initial position, grows like t1/2. This implies that clusters
are not trapped in small patches with favorable environ-
mental conditions but move (through the birth-death pro-
cess) randomly within the plot.

@Newman2005 Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law

Another example of the “combination of exponentials” mechanism has been discussed by Reed and
Hughes [43]. They consider a process in which a set of items, piles or groups each grows exponentially in time, having size x ∼ e^bt with b > 0. For instance, populations of organisms reproducing freely without resource con- straints grow exponentially. Items also have some fixed probability of dying per unit time (populations might have a stochastically constant probability of extinction), so that the times t at which they die are exponentially distributed p(t) ∼ e^at with a < 0.

@Sole2006

Understanding the origins of scaling can provide valuable information about the origins of ecological complexity. Sometimes it is asked why scaling laws are relevant. They are in fact the key to understanding a large number of phenomena using simple and clever theories. There is no reason, in principle, why scale-free, power law relations should apply to biological systems. But actually they do and are widespread. The presence of fractal patterns reveals the nonequilibrium conditions under which structures at different levels are created and how large-scale patterns are generated from local interactions. They have provided the clues to understanding the origins of allometric scaling in biology (Brown and West 2000) and are a necessary ingredients of any theory of ecological organization. As Brown and coworkers have indicated, the self similar structure of many ecosystems properties reflects the constraints on their organization, which stems from basic physical, biological and even mathematical principles (Brown et al. 2002).

@VanRooij2013 A Fractal Approach to Dynamic Inference and Distribution Analysis

This article is motivated by the insight that the shape of
probability distributions of events reveals information about the
dynamics that govern a system’s output. The approach leverages
the fact that the essential nature of the dynamics that govern many
natural stochastic systems can be understood without specific
knowledge of the components that comprise the system itself
(Holden et al., 2009; Holden and Rajaraman, 2012).

Characteristic system dynamics originate in the relationships
among the processes that comprise a system. Our introduc-
tion briefly distinguished two broad taxonomies of characteristic
system dynamics: component-dominant dynamics and interaction-
dominant dynamics. They each entail distinct system transactions,
superposition, and interdependence, respectively.


Thus,
Gaussian distributions emerge from systems whose observables
are subject to vast arrays of relatively weak, additive, and inde-
pendently acting perturbations: component-dominant systems.

Interaction-dominant dynamics are associated with
systems that entail tightly coupled processes spanning a wide
range of temporal or spatial scales, including fractal systems.
They refer to systems that entail multiplicative and/or interde-
pendent feedback transactions among the processes that govern
the system’s dynamics

Of course,
power law scaling alone is not sufficient to establish criticality.
That said, self-organization and critical behavior
are generally accepted as plausible working hypotheses with the
observation of non-trivial scaling in complex biological systems

@Clauset2009

Because formulas for continuous distributions, such as (2.2), tend to be simpler
than those for discrete distributions, it is common to approximate discrete power-law
behavior with its continuous counterpart for the sake of mathematical convenience.
But a word of caution is in order: there are several different ways to approximate
a discrete power law by a continuous one and though some of them give reasonable
results, others do not. One relatively reliable method is to treat an integer power
law as if the values of x were generated from a continuous power law then rounded
to the nearest integer.

@Barnosky2012

In the context of forecasting biological change, the realization that 
critical transitions and state shifts can occur on the global scale3,12,15–18, as
well as on smaller scales, is of great importance. One key question is how
to recognize a global-scale state shift

Finally, because the global-scale ecosystem comprises many smaller-
scale, spatially bounded complex systems (for instance the community
within a given physiographic region), each of which overlaps and interacts
with others, state shifts of the small-scale components can propagate to
cause a state shift of the entire system21.

@Frank2009

Much of biological research is reverse engineering. We observe a pattern or design, and we try to infer the underlying process that generated what we see. The observed patterns can often be described as probability distributions.

We must understand why these distributions are so common and what they tell us, because our goal is to use these observed patterns to reverse engineer the underlying processes that created those patterns. What information do these distributions contain?

The key probability distributions often arise as the most random pattern consistent with the information expressed by a few constraints (Jaynes, 2003)

Why should observed probability distributions tend towards those with maximum entropy? Because observed patterns typically arise by the aggregation of many small-scale processes. Any directionality or non- randomness caused by each small-scale process tends, on average, to be cancelled in the aggregate: one fluctuation pushes in one direction, another fluctuation pushes in a different direction and so on

In terms of information, the final pattern reflects only the information content of the system expressed by the constraints on randomness; all else dissipates to maximum entropy as the pattern converges to its limiting distribution defined by its informational constraints.

With an increasing number of processes, the aggregate increases in entropy towards the maximum, stable value of disorder defined by the sampling structure and the information preserved through the multiple rounds of perturbations.

@Manor2008

Recent reports (Scanlon et al., 2007; Kefi et al., 2007) have demonstrated power-law statistics of the patch size for vegetation ecosystems in the arid and semi-arid climatic zone across a wide range along the annual rainfall gradient. As pointed out in Scanlon et al. (2007) and Kefi et al. (2007), this phenomenon is actually puzzling. 

Typically, the distribution of sizes in nature (the height of different individuals within a single species is a classical example) tends to be Gaussian; its average is dictated by physical and biological constraints (e.g., the ability of the muscles to support the body) and the deviations from the average are attributed to many ‘‘small’’ random effects, like the genetic mixture of an individual and resource availability during its development. The central limit theorem assures that, in such a case, the results are normally distributed around their mean, and large fluctuations (in units of the standard deviation) are exponentially rare. Power-law, or otherwise fat-tailed distributions, are an exception of this scenario, and when such a distribution appears one should look for a mechanism that invalidates that simple logic.

@Oborny2005

Universality’ is not an exaggeration: analyses have shown (Broadabent and Hammersley 1957, Hinrichsen 2000b) that the values of the critical exponents do not depend on the details of the model, only on the dimensionality

@Zinck2009

Here we show that two typical generic wildfire models from ecology are structurally equivalent to the most commonly used model from statistical physics. All three models can be unified to a single model in which they appear as special cases of regrowth-dependent flammability. This local "ecological memory" of former fire events is key to self-organization in wildfire ecosystems. 


----------------------
@White2012

Systems are expected to be in their most likely state when the processes influencing the system combine in such a way that they effectively cancel each other out at the system level. Community-level patterns in ecological systems are known to reflect the influence of myriad processes and thus may exemplify such a phenomenon (Frank 2011, Harte 2011).

@Malhi2014

Tropical forests are arguably the most significant biomes on the planet, accounting for one-
third of land-surface productivity and evapotranspiration (5), and are estimated to host over half of
all global terrestrial biodiversity (6). Humans have been interacting with and modifying tropical
forests for tens of thousands of years, but the intensity of this interaction has been increasing
substantially in the Anthropocene. As with other biomes, tropical forests have experienced effects
of the Anthropocene that are multifaceted and include conversion to agricultural use, logging and
other resource extraction, increased fire incidence, hunting and wildlife trade, global intercon-
nectivity and its associated spread of introduced species and pathogens, altered biogeochemical
cycles, and climate change.

@Lenton2013 On the origin of planetary-scale tipping points

The use of ‘planetary-scale’ tipping point suggests to us and to
Brook et al. [2] synchronous or near-synchronous tipping on a global
scale. Hughes et al. [3] concede this ‘is very unlikely’ for the terrestrial
biosphere, yet they persevere with the term when describing
nonsynchronous cascades of smaller-scale tipping points that
ultimately add up to global effects. Here, the critical uncertainty is
whether the causal coupling between different tipping events is of the
sign and strength necessary to produce a global tipping cascade (e.g.,
Figure 1, main text). The ‘planetary-scale tipping point’ terminology
may not be helpful because complex systems, such as the biosphere,
often show scale-free distributions of event sizes [14].

Scenarios for global biodiversity in the 21st century.

Arguably, the conversion of forest to agricultural systems has been the most important of these habitat changes. In most land-use scenarios, global forest area declines slightly over the next few decades (Fig. 3), resulting from extensive deforestation in tropical forests and subtropical woodlands, which is partially offset by increased forest cover in the Northern Hemisphere (33, 34, 38).
Therefore, in terms of impacts on biodiversity, the overall picture is worse than the global forest
projections indicate, as the habitat losses in the
tropics cannot be directly compensated by forest
habitat gains in temperate regions, and some of
the forest gains in both regions are due to the
expansion of species-poor plantations.

@Crowther2015a

Forest ecosystems harbour a large proportion of global biodiversity, contribute extensively to biogeochemical cycles, and provide countless ecosystem services, including water quality control, timber stocks and carbon sequestration1–4. Our current understanding of the global forest extent has been generated using remote sensing approaches that provide spatially explicit values relating to forest area and canopy cover3,5,6

@Potapov2008

Protection of large natural forest landscapes is a highly important task to help fulfill different international strategic initiatives to protect forest biodiversity, to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to stimulate sustainable forest management practices. This paper introduces a new approach for mapping large intact forest landscapes (IFL), defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km2.

As a result, the presence of food-web modules depended strongly on patch size: large and well-connected patches supported complex food-web modules, but only the simplest modules involving the most abundant species were found on small patches.

@Martin2015

Thus, catastrophic shifts can actually appear in noisy systems. However, we also show that adding any of the following ingredients, (i) enhanced demographic variability, (ii) limited dispersal/diffusivity, and/or (iii) spatial (quenched) heterogeneity, suffices to alter the nature of the phase transition,
giving rise to a second-order (continuous) one.
