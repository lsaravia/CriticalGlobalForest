[@Haddad2015] Habitat fragmentation and its lasting impact on Earth’s ecosystems


##  Fragmentation Analysis – Global 

The global distance-to-edge map and histogram (Figure 1A, B) were generated from a global, 30-m resolution raster dataset of percent tree cover for the year 2000 (Sexton et al. 2013). Pixels covered with clouds or shadows in 2000 were filled with values from the same dataset in 2005, and those obscured by clouds or shadows in both 2000 and 2005 were filled with values from the MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover layer for the year 2000 (DiMiceli et al. 2011). Following the United Nations’ International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme definition of forest (Belward 1996), tree-cover values were converted from percentages to binary forest/non-forest cover by applying a threshold of 30% cover: pixels with tree cover less than 30% were labeled “non-forest”, and those with tree cover greater than or equal to 30% were labeled “forest”. A minimum mapping unit (MMU) filter was then applied to the binary map, re-coding the values of any contiguous group of pixels—whether forest or non-forest—whose combined area was less than one hectare to that of the surrounding pixels. The resulting 30-m resolution binary raster of forest vs. non-forest cover with MMU of 1 ha was then coarsened to 90-m resolution using a majority rule.

@Weerman2012 Changes in diatom patch-size distribution and degradation in a spatially self-organized intertidal mudflat ecosystem

we used a cumulative distribution in which no binning is used. The patch-size distributions were fitted using the following equation describing an upper-truncated cumulative number-size distribution based on a power law (Burroughs and Tebbens 2001):


where M(r) is the cumulative fitting function of patches
of size r (in cm2), C is a constant, c is the scaling

A recent paper of Pueyo (2011) showed that, for
fundamental reasons, we should move away from the
power law vs. truncated power law dichotomy to other
categorizations. More precisely, a truncated power law
can be fitted to all the data sets (if taken at a large
enough scale) and we expect that truncation becomes
stronger when a dryland approaches degradation
(following similar reasoning as Kefi et al. [2007]). In
line with this, all our patch-size distributions were fitted
using Eq. 1. To evaluate the degree of the truncation of
the curves, we defined the observed truncation to be th



The loss of cover fraction of vegetation, or of other
organisms, is the most direct way to assess the degree of
deterioration of ecosystems (Reynolds et al. 2007,
Maestre and Escudero 2009, 2010). However, ecosys-
tems with strong feedback mechanisms can respond
nonlinearly, involving tipping points, to gradually
increased stress (Rietkerk et al. 2004, Scheffer et al.
2009). In those cases, the cover fraction at which a
tipping point occurs is unknown, and cover fraction
alone is not sufficient to indicate the proximity of a
tipping point in the ecosystem (Kefi et al. 2010).

The number of H. prunifolius clusters of area s, n(s), is
presented in figure 2 on a double-logarithmic scale. The
distribution is clearly fat-tailed, and the large s tail resem-
bles a straight line, apparently reflecting a power law. It
deviates strongly from the Poisson forest limit, which has
an exponential cutoff at large s.

# Motion detection algorithm
To test the relevance of spatial heterogeneity, we tracked
clusters over time, using a simple motion-detection al-
gorithm (see fig. 3A). We identified all of the clusters in
two consecutive censuses and checked, for any cluster in
the latter census, whether it had at least one colored square
in common with a cluster in the former census. If there
was such a square, the latter cluster was assigned the same
index number as the former, so that they were considered
two instances of the same cluster. If there was no such
overlap, the latter cluster was designated as new. If a cluster
had split between one census and the next, the larger piece
kept the index number of the original cluster, and the
smaller one was considered new. When two clusters
merged, the merged cluster was assigned the same index
as the larger of the two original clusters.


If spatial heterogeneity is strong, then large patches have
to be associated with favored spatial locations, while the
small clusters, like the singletons, will appear in the non-
favored regions. In such a case, the response to spatially
uniform stress varies with cluster size. We implemented a
motion-tracking algorithm in order to follow the dynamics
of the cluster over time (see fig. 3). This allowed the ex-
traction of the per capita birth/death rate from the dif-
ferences between consecutive censuses, which was then
plotted against the patch size in figure 3B. The result is
independent of size (up to the noise that reflects the rel-
ative rarity of large patches), suggesting that a patch of
size s shrinks or grows by a number proportional to s
(multiplicative random walk; see Manor and Shnerb
2008a, 2008b).

As further evidence against the niche assembly hypoth-
esis, we measured the average displacement of the center
of mass of patches as a function of time. The movement
of the patches appears similar to a simple random walk
(fig. 4), because Dr, the distance of the center of mass from
its initial position, grows like t1/2. This implies that clusters
are not trapped in small patches with favorable environ-
mental conditions but move (through the birth-death pro-
cess) randomly within the plot.

@Newman2005 Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law

Another example of the “combination of exponentials” mechanism has been discussed by Reed and
Hughes [43]. They consider a process in which a set of items, piles or groups each grows exponentially in time, having size x ∼ e^bt with b > 0. For instance, populations of organisms reproducing freely without resource con- straints grow exponentially. Items also have some fixed probability of dying per unit time (populations might have a stochastically constant probability of extinction), so that the times t at which they die are exponentially distributed p(t) ∼ e^at with a < 0.

@Sole2006

Understanding the origins of scaling can provide valuable information about the origins of ecological complexity. Sometimes it is asked why scaling laws are relevant. They are in fact the key to understanding a large number of phenomena using simple and clever theories. There is no reason, in principle, why scale-free, power law relations should apply to biological systems. But actually they do and are widespread. The presence of fractal patterns reveals the nonequilibrium conditions under which structures at different levels are created and how large-scale patterns are generated from local interactions. They have provided the clues to understanding the origins of allometric scaling in biology (Brown and West 2000) and are a necessary ingredients of any theory of ecological organization. As Brown and coworkers have indicated, the self similar structure of many ecosystems properties reflects the constraints on their organization, which stems from basic physical, biological and even mathematical principles (Brown et al. 2002).

@VanRooij2013 A Fractal Approach to Dynamic Inference and Distribution Analysis

This article is motivated by the insight that the shape of
probability distributions of events reveals information about the
dynamics that govern a system’s output. The approach leverages
the fact that the essential nature of the dynamics that govern many
natural stochastic systems can be understood without specific
knowledge of the components that comprise the system itself
(Holden et al., 2009; Holden and Rajaraman, 2012).

Characteristic system dynamics originate in the relationships
among the processes that comprise a system. Our introduc-
tion briefly distinguished two broad taxonomies of characteristic
system dynamics: component-dominant dynamics and interaction-
dominant dynamics. They each entail distinct system transactions,
superposition, and interdependence, respectively.


Thus,
Gaussian distributions emerge from systems whose observables
are subject to vast arrays of relatively weak, additive, and inde-
pendently acting perturbations: component-dominant systems.

Interaction-dominant dynamics are associated with
systems that entail tightly coupled processes spanning a wide
range of temporal or spatial scales, including fractal systems.
They refer to systems that entail multiplicative and/or interde-
pendent feedback transactions among the processes that govern
the system’s dynamics

Of course,
power law scaling alone is not sufficient to establish criticality.
That said, self-organization and critical behavior
are generally accepted as plausible working hypotheses with the
observation of non-trivial scaling in complex biological systems
