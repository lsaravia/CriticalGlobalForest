[@Haddad2015] Habitat fragmentation and its lasting impact on Earth’s ecosystems


##  Fragmentation Analysis – Global 

The global distance-to-edge map and histogram (Figure 1A, B) were generated from a global, 30-m resolution raster dataset of percent tree cover for the year 2000 (Sexton et al. 2013). Pixels covered with clouds or shadows in 2000 were filled with values from the same dataset in 2005, and those obscured by clouds or shadows in both 2000 and 2005 were filled with values from the MOderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover layer for the year 2000 (DiMiceli et al. 2011). Following the United Nations’ International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme definition of forest (Belward 1996), tree-cover values were converted from percentages to binary forest/non-forest cover by applying a threshold of 30% cover: pixels with tree cover less than 30% were labeled “non-forest”, and those with tree cover greater than or equal to 30% were labeled “forest”. A minimum mapping unit (MMU) filter was then applied to the binary map, re-coding the values of any contiguous group of pixels—whether forest or non-forest—whose combined area was less than one hectare to that of the surrounding pixels. The resulting 30-m resolution binary raster of forest vs. non-forest cover with MMU of 1 ha was then coarsened to 90-m resolution using a majority rule.

@Weerman2012 Changes in diatom patch-size distribution and degradation in a spatially self-organized intertidal mudflat ecosystem

we used a cumulative distribution in which no binning is used. The patch-size distributions were fitted using the following equation describing an upper-truncated cumulative number-size distribution based on a power law (Burroughs and Tebbens 2001):


where M(r) is the cumulative fitting function of patches
of size r (in cm2), C is a constant, c is the scaling

A recent paper of Pueyo (2011) showed that, for
fundamental reasons, we should move away from the
power law vs. truncated power law dichotomy to other
categorizations. More precisely, a truncated power law
can be fitted to all the data sets (if taken at a large
enough scale) and we expect that truncation becomes
stronger when a dryland approaches degradation
(following similar reasoning as Kefi et al. [2007]). In
line with this, all our patch-size distributions were fitted
using Eq. 1. To evaluate the degree of the truncation of
the curves, we defined the observed truncation to be th



The loss of cover fraction of vegetation, or of other
organisms, is the most direct way to assess the degree of
deterioration of ecosystems (Reynolds et al. 2007,
Maestre and Escudero 2009, 2010). However, ecosys-
tems with strong feedback mechanisms can respond
nonlinearly, involving tipping points, to gradually
increased stress (Rietkerk et al. 2004, Scheffer et al.
2009). In those cases, the cover fraction at which a
tipping point occurs is unknown, and cover fraction
alone is not sufficient to indicate the proximity of a
tipping point in the ecosystem (Kefi et al. 2010).
