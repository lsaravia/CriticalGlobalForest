# Analysis of critical transitions at the Global Forest## AbstractGlobal forests [](SRD Does "Global forests" has a precise definition? It's not mentioned elsewhere, maybe "Forest ecosystems" it's better?) provide critical habitat for many species, ecosystem services, and are coupled to atmospheric dynamics and gases. One of the most important changes produced in the biosphere is the replacement of forest areas with human dominated landscapes. These areas contain many fewer species than the natural ecosystem they replaced, and this change is one of the main drivers of extinctions in the Anthropocene of [](SRD This is a key point, yet it's not mentioned elsewhere in the paper, I think it should be documented at least in a general manner). The dynamics of forest fragments or patches are central to their function as an ecosystem. In different kinds of vegetation, including forests, the empirical patch size distributions follow approximate power laws, a pattern that can be used as a signal of critical phase transitions, where the system state changes suddenly at a critical point; in the case of forest patches, this implies an abrupt change in connectivity that poses a risk to forest function as a habitat and ecosystem. All these patterns have been observed at relatively small scales, however. Here we studied the distribution of forest patch sizes at a global level and its changes over the last fourteen years, using the closeness of forest at the continental level as a possible early warning indicator of critical transitions, and combining five separate criteria to detect closeness to a fragmentation threshold. Most regions, except the Eurasian mainland, followed a power-law distribution. We found that only the tropical forest of Africa and South America met the five criteria and thus seemed to be near a critical fragmentation threshold. This implies that the combined influence of human pressures and climate forcings might trigger undesired effects of fragmentation such as species loss and [TODO] in these regions. The simple models proposed here could be used to estimate fragmentation thresholds, and inform the management practices needed to stop this trend.## IntroductionForests are some of the most important ecosystems on earth, providing habitat for a large proportion of species and contributing extensively to global biodiversity [@Crowther2015a]. [] (SRD In this first paragraph I think the way to go is to focus on how forests have been altered). In the previous century human activities have reached a global scale of influence, modifying global bio-geochemical cycles [@Canfield2010], [](SRD Instead of only referencing to BGC cycles, maybe a short list for high impact changes at a global scale). One of the most dramatic changes being the replacement of 40% of Earth's formerly biodiverse land areas with landscapes that contain only a few species of crop plants, domestic animals and humans [@Foley2011] [](SRD Yet this is not specific of forests, but land areas). These changes have been happening locally, but they have been accumulated over time and have reached a global scale that constitutes a global forcing [@Barnosky2012].  One global scale forcing that is tied to habitat destruction is fragmentation, which is defined as the division of a continuous habitat into separated portions that are smaller and more isolated. Fragmentation produces multiple interwoven effects: reductions of biodiversity between 13% and 75%, decreasing forest biomass and changes in nutrient cycling [@Haddad2015]. The effects of fragmentation are not only important from an ecological point of view, but also human activities and ecosystem services supply and flow are deeply influenced by the level of landscape fragmentation [@Mitchell2015]. [](SRD I think a connection is needed between paragraphs here, maybe a phrase such as: "One open and pressing issue in ecology it is whether we can diagnose and anticipate changes in the biosphere caused by global scale forcings, such as the fragmentation of forest ecosystems...". Also, a short but strong fundament of why forests might suffer a critical transition would help as a connection with the following, and/or a clear statement regarding whether there is a consensus regarding this issue)Complex interactions in ecosystems between species and feedbacks at different levels of organization, can produce abrupt changes called critical transitions [@Scheffer2009; @Gilman2010]] [](SRD A link to external forcings or changes in prevailing conditions can be made in the definition of critical transitions? I actually doubt what external forcings actual meaning might be here when we are trying to think globally, but I think a connection to global change and critical transitions would ease reading). These abrupt state shifts cannot be linearly forecasted from past changes, and are thus difficult to predict and manage [@Scheffer2009]. Critical transitions had been detected mostly at local scales [@Carpenter2011; @Drake2010], but the accumulation of changes in local communities that overlap geographically can propagate and cause an abrupt change of the entire system at larger scales [@Barnosky2012]. Coupled with the existence of global scale forcings, this implies the possibility that a critical transition could occur at a global scale [@Rockstrom2009; @Folke2011].  Complex systems in general can experience two general classes of critical transitions. In the so-called first order transitions, a catastrophic regime shift that is mostly irreversible occurs because of the existence of alternative stable states [@Scheffer2001] [](SRD Scheffer 2001 do not distinguish between first or second order transitions, I think a reference for the classification is needed here). This class of critical transitions have been described for a variety of ecological systems, including vegetation cover in semiarid regions [@Kefi2007a], shallow lakes [@Scheffer2009], and biological invasions [@Taylor2005].[](SRD I understand Alle effect in Taylor 2005 can be regarded as a positive feedback and a shift between states, but references are mostly about results from modelling, probably it's better to restrict references to observations here I the point to be made is critical transitions are an actual phenomena and not just modelling outcomes), as well as in many other physical, biological and social systems [@Sole2011]. [](SRD I erased details of semiarid vegetation and added shallow lakes examples, so as to assert critical transitions of this kind are indeed common) First order transitions can arise as the result of external forcing on systems where positive feedback mechanisms prevail [@Martin2015]. For example, the growth of forest in a site is more probable if it is surrounded by forest than if it is surrounded by cultivated or degraded land [@Xu2015b]. [](SRD Including known examples of these transitions in forests will be a nice ending, such as the ones cited in Scheffer2001)The other class of critical transitions are continuous, or second order transitions [@Sole2006]. In these cases, there is a narrow region where the system changes from one domain to another, with the change being sudden, continuous, and in theory reversible. These transitions are linked to spatial patterns [](SRD Not clear for me: only to spatial patterns? First order ones are not? Both can be?), and at the critical point we can observe scale invariant fractal structures characterized by power law patch distributions [@Stauffer1994]. [](SRD I think it's important to clarify this adding examples of systems where these class of transitions have been described, given the previous paragraph one wonders whether this class of transitions are reported for a variety of systems such as first-order ones or not.) [] (SRD I like the short introduction to critical transitions and think it's good for a general reader, but a key point would be to make it general enough but at the same time keep ideas centered on forests. Also - but maybe later in the text- focusing on what's known on critical transitions at smaller scales from studying patterns found in empirical data, since this is the framework on this work and hopefully one of its main contributions).[] (SRD general comment: Up to this point, the ideas seem concise and clear. To connect with the rest of the intro, I think a paragraph stating how the critical transition in forest are known or expected to be is needed: only second order transitions are expected to occur, or both... or we are not sure? If this is presented, then percolation can be presented and see as a way to address the issue of whether forests are heading toward a critical point.)[](SRD It seems to me the following edition of subsequent paragraphs, with further re-writing, may serve as the connection I mention before, what do you think?)One of the main challenges when with systems that can experience critical transitions is that the value of the critical threshold is not known in advance. In addition, because near the critical point a small change can precipitate a state shift of the system, critical transitions are difficult to predict. Several methods have been developed to detect how close to the critical point a system is, e.g. a deceleration in recovery from perturbations, or an increase in variance in the spatial or temporal pattern [@Carpenter2011; @Dai2012; @Hastings2010b; @Boettiger2012]. In forests, there are several processes such as demographic fluctuations, spatial heterogeneities, and dispersal limitation that introduce stochasticity and thus can convert catastrophic, first-order transitions into a second-order transitions [@Martin2015]. Continuous transitions should be therefore more probable than catastrophic transitions, and some evidence of a second order critical transition related to drought and fire has been found in tropical forest [@Pueyo2010]. [] (SRD Now, if all transitions forest can experience are indeed second-order, the connection with percolation theory seems easier to understand.)The spatial phenomena observed in second-order, continuous critical transitions deal with connectivity, a fundamental property of general systems and ecosystems from forests [@Ochoa-Quintero2015] to marine ecosystems [@Leibold2004a] and the whole biosphere [@Lenton2013] [](SRD Do you mean connectivity on a broader, functional sense, or in a more restricted, spatially connected sort?]. When a system transitions from a fragmented to a connected state we say that it percolates [@Sole2011]. Percolation implies that there is a path of connections that involves the whole system. Thus we can characterize two domains or phases: one dominated by short-range interactions where information cannot spread, and another in which long range interactions are possible and information can spread over the whole area. (The term "information" is used in a broad sense and can represent species dispersal or movement.) There is thus a critical "percolation threshold" between the two phases, and a system could be driven close to or beyond this point by an external force[] (SRD Not sure how this paragraph contributes to the flow of ideas...) The simplest model [](SRD forest models?) where we can observe a second-order transition is a random map, in which each site has an independent probability $p$ of being occupied. Even in this simple setting, starting with $p=0$, when $p$ reaches a certain value the landscape changes from fragmented to a connected state. Another more relevant model concerns forest fires and ecological memory: biomass is consumed in a fire, and afterwards some time must pass to build up fuel before a subsequent fire can occur [@Zinck2009].The behavior of this last model is called a self-organized criticality where the system drives itself to the critical region, so the critical behavior is observed for a wide range of parameter with the condition that a double separation of scales exist [@Pascual2005a]. The rate of producing new fires (lightning) should be much slower than the rate of growth of trees and in turn the growth of trees is slow compared with the velocity of fire spread.    Climate change and deforestation are the main forces that could be the drivers of a phase change in contemporary forests [@Bonan2008;@Haddad2015]. Species' dispersal strategies are influenced by percolation thresholds in three-dimensional forest structure [@Sole2005], and it has been shown that species distributions also have percolation thresholds [@He2003]. This implies that pushing the system below the percolation threshold could produce a biodiversity collapse [Pardini2010;@Bascompte1996; @Sole2004c]. Conversely, being above the percolation threshold in a connected state could accelerate the invasion of forest into prairie [@Loehle1996b; @Naito2015]. From the point of view of percolation theory, the necessary condition to be near a critical transition is that the patch size distribution [](SRD Define patch size distribution] follows a power-law. [TODO: unclear) But this is not a sufficient condition, because power-law distributions are present in a wide range of conditions, for example in arid ecosystem vegetation [@Kefi2007b; @Scanlon2007], ant colonies [@Vandermeer2008], and attached microalgae [@Saravia2012a; @DalBello2014] [](SRD I think will it will make more sense if analysis is restricted to forest ecosystems or very similar systems; not sure if and colonies would seems to a general reader related to forest dynamics unless a clear and probably long explanation is included). The origin of these power-laws is attributed to a facilitation mechanisms [@Manor2008a; @Irvine2016], that is likely to be present in forest [@Bulleri2008]. [TODO: this paragraph doesn't fit well into the rest of the introduction]. [](SRD One last thing: if power laws alone are not sufficient, what do we propose?!)[](SRD I think we can dare say upfront that the aim of this work is to address the issue of whether, at the continental scale, forest ecosystems are heading toward a critical transition, and leave the rest as a short methods description.)In this study, our objectives were to evaluate what models best describe forest patch distribution at a continental scale; examine how patch size and connectivity change between regions and across time; and look for evidence that forests are near critical fragmentation thresholds. The advantage of using data at a continental scale is that for very large systems the transitions are very sharp [TODO: reference?] and thus much easier to detect than at smaller scales, where noise can mask the signals of the transition.## Methods### Study areas definitionWe analyzed mainland forests at a continental scale, covering the whole globe, by delimiting land areas with a near-contiguous forest cover, separated with each other by large non-forested areas. Using this criterion, we delimited the following forest regions. In America, three regions were defined: South America temperate forest (SAT), subtropical and tropical forest up to Mexico (SAST), and [](SRD boreal forests?) USA and Canada forest (NA). Europe and North Asia were treated as one region (EUAS). The rest of the delimited regions were South-east Asia (SEAS), Africa (AF), and Australia (OC). We also included in the analysis islands larger than\si{10^5 km^2} (Supplementary figure S1-S6).### Forest distributionWe studied forests distribution in each defined area from 2000 to 2014 using the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) Tree Cover dataset version 051 [@DiMiceli2015]. This dataset is produced at a global level with a 231-m resolution, from 2000 onwards, and on an annual basis. There are several definition of forest based on percent tree cover [@Sexton2015]. We choose a 30% threshold to convert the percentage tree cover to a binary image of forest and non-forest pixels, given that this is the definition used by the United Nations’ International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme [@Belward1996], and studies of global fragmentation [@Haddad2015]. [](SRD More works have used this threshold?). This definition avoids the errors produced by low discrimination of MODIS VCF between forest and dense herbaceous vegetation at low forest cover [@Sexton2015]. Patches of contiguous forest were determined in the binary image by grouping connected forest pixels using a neighborhood of 8 forest units (Moore neighborhood). ### Percolation theoryA more in-depth introduction to percolation theory can be found elsewhere [@Stauffer1994], and a review from an ecological point of view is available [@Oborny2007]. To explain the basic elements of percolation theory, here we formulate a simple model: we represent our area of interest by a square lattice and each site of the lattice can be occupied---e.g. by forest---with a probability $p$. The lattice will have a greater cover when $p$ is greater, but the sites are randomly distributed. We are interested in the connection between sites, so we define a neighborhood as the eight adjacent sites surrounding any particular site. Sites that are neighbors of other occupied sites define a patch. When there is a patch that connects the lattice from opposite sides, it is said that the system percolates. When $p$ is increased from low values, a percolating patch suddenly appears when $p$ exceeds a certain value called the critical point,  $p_c$. Percolation is thus characterized by two well defined phases. The unconnected phase, called subcritical in physics, when $p<p_c$, in which species cannot travel far across the forest, as it is fragmented; in a general sense, information cannot spread. The other is the connected phase, called supercritical, when $p>p_c$: species can move within a forest patch from side to side of the area (lattice), i.e. information can spread over the whole area. Near the critical point several scaling laws arise: the structure of the patch that spans the area is fractal, the size distribution of the patches is power-law, and other quantities also follow power-law scaling [@Stauffer1994].   The value of the critical point $p_c$ depends on the geometry of the lattice and on the definition of the neighborhood, but other power-law exponents only depend on the lattice dimension. Close to the critical point, the distribution of patch sizes is:(@e1) $n_s(p_c) \propto s^{-\alpha}$ where $n_s(p)$ is the number of patches of size $s$. The exponent $\alpha$ does not depend on the details of the model, and it is therefore said to be universal [@Stauffer1994]. These scaling laws can be applied for landscape structures that are approximately random, with correlations if the forest sites are correlated over short distances [@Gastner2009]. In physics this is called an "isotropic percolation universality class", and corresponds to an exponent $\alpha=2.05495$. If we observe that the patch size distribution has another exponent, it will not belong to this universality class and some other mechanism should be invoked to explain it. Percolation thresholds can also be generated by models that have some kind of memory [@Odor2004; @Hinrichsen2000]: for example, if a patch that has been exploited for many years will recover different than a recently deforested forest patch. In this case, the system can belong to a different universality class, or in some cases there is no universality, in which case the value of $\alpha$ will depend on the parameters and details of the model [@Corrado2014]. ### Patch size distributionsWe fitted the empirical distribution of forest patch areas, based on the MODIS-derived data described above, to four distributions using maximum likelihood estimation [@Goldstein2004;@Clauset2009]. The distributions were: power-law, power-law with exponential cut-off, log-normal, and exponential. We assumed that the patch size distribution is a continuous variable that was discretized by the remote sensing data acquisition procedure.We set a minimal patch size ($X_{min}$) at nine pixels to fit the patch size distributions to avoid artifacts at patch edges due to discretization [@Weerman2012]. Besides this hard $X_{min}$ limit we set due to discretization, the power-law distribution needs a lower bound for its scaling behavior. This lower bound is also estimated from the data by maximizing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic computed by comparing the empirical and fitted cumulative distribution functions [@Clauset2009]. We also calculated the uncertainty of the parameters using a non-parametric bootstrap method [@Efron1994], and computed corrected Akaike Information Criteria ($AIC_c$) and Akaike weights for each model [@Burnham2002]. Akaike weights ($w_i$) are the weight of evidence in favor of model $i$ being the actual best model given that one of the $N$ models must be the best model for that set of $N$ models.Additionally, we computed the goodness of fit of the power-law model following the bootstrap approach described by Clauset et. al [-@Clauset2009], where simulated data sets following the fitted model are generated, and a $p$-value computed as the proportion of simulated data sets that has a KS statistic less extreme than empirical data. The criterion to reject the power law model was $p\le0.1$ but as we have a very large $n$, meaning that negligible small deviations could produce a rejection [@Klaus2011], we chose a $p\le0.05$ to reject the power law model. [](SRD not clear why to mention the 0.1 criterion if it was not used? p = 0.1 is recommended by Klauss 2011?). To test for differences between the fitted power law exponent for each study area, we used a weighted linear regression with a residual auto-correlation structure. Weights were the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals and we added an auto-regressive model of order 1 to the residuals to account for temporal autocorrelation. ### Largest patch dynamicsThe largest patch is the one that connects the highest number of forest sites in an area, and this metric has been used extensively to indicate fragmentation [@Ochoa-Quintero2015; @Gardner2007]. The relation of the size of the largest patch $S_{max}$ to critical transitions has been extensively studied in relation to percolation phenomena [Bazant2000;Botet2004;@Stauffer1994], but seldom used in ecological studies (but see [-@Gastner2009]). When the system is in a connected state ($p>p_c$), the landscape is almost insensitive to the loss of a small fraction of forest, but close to the critical point a minor loss can have important effects [@Sole2006; @Oborny2007], because at this point the largest patch will have a filamentary structure, i.e. extended forest areas will be connected by thin threads. Small losses can thus produce large fluctuations. One way to evaluate the fragmentation of the forest is to calculate the proportion of the largest patch against the total area [@Keitt1997]. The total area of the regions we are considering (Supplementary figure S1-S6) [](SRD since we will not include total area determination, I think its better to just not include total area data in figures or elsewhere, only total forest area - mean and min-max values maybe) may not be the same than the total area that the forest could potentially occupy, thus a more accurate way to evaluate the weight of $S_{max}$ is to use the total forest area. We calculate the proportion of the largest patch for each year, dividing $S_{max}$ by the total forest area of the same year: $RS_{max} = S_{max}/\sum_{i}S_i$. This has the effect of reducing the $S_{max}$ fluctuations produced due to environmental or climatic changes influences in total forest area.  When the proportion $RS_{max}$ is large (more than 60%) the largest patch contains most of the forest so there are fewer small forest patches and the system is probably in a connected phase. Conversely, when it is low (less than 20%), the system is probably in a fragmented phase. [](SRD This has been studied, is there a published work to cite?)It is also possible that a system with high $RS_{max}$ is near a percolation threshold, and this can be evaluated using the temporal fluctuations. We computed the fluctuations around the mean with the absolute values $\Delta S_{max}=S_{max}(t)-\langle S_{max} \rangle$, using the proportions of $RS_{max}$. To characterize fluctuations, we fitted three empirical distributions: power-law, log-normal, and exponential, using the same methods previously described. We expect that large fluctuation near a critical point have heavy tails (log-normal or power-law) and that fluctuations far from a critical point have exponential tails, corresponding to Gaussian processes [](SRD Why? Based on @Stauffer1994?). As the data set spans 15 years, we do not have enough statistical power to reliably detect which distribution is better [@Clauset2009], so we also performed the goodness of fit test described above for all the fitted distributions. We generated animated maps showing the fluctuations of the 2 largest patches to aid in the interpretations of the results.A robust way to detect if the system is near a critical transition is to analyze the increase in variance of the density [@Benedetti-Cecchi2015]; in the case of a forest, the density is the area of forest cover divided by total area. There are several issues in the estimation of density of a forest. One of the challenges is to define the total area that the forest can potentially colonize, and its estimation would introduce more uncertainty in the density estimate. Another problem is that since the variance increase in density only appears when the system is very close to the transition [@Corrado2014], this does not constitute an early warning indicator. An alternative that we used in this work is to analyze the variance of the fluctuations of the largest patch $\Delta S_{max}$: a maximum fluctuation will be attained at the critical point, but a significant increase occurs well before the system reaches that point [@Corrado2014]. In addition, before the critical point [](SRD it said critical fragmentation instead of critical point, but it is not mentioned in this way before. It is the change ok?), the skewness of the distribution of $\Delta S_{max}$ should be negative, implying that fluctuations below the average are more frequent [](SRD cite?). We characterized the increase in the variance using quantile regression: if variance is increasing the slopes of upper or/and lower quartiles should be positive or negative.   [](SRD Should we make a different subsection, such as data analysis and reproducibility?)Image processing was done in MATLAB r2015b (The Mathworks Inc.). All statistical analyses were performed using the GNU R version 3.3.0 [@RCoreTeam2015]. We used code provided by Cosma R. Shalizi for power law with exponential cutoff model, the poweRlaw package [@Gillespie2015] for fitting the other distributions, and function gls from nlme package [@Pinheiro2016] for the weighted linear regression. [](SRD Quantile regression code not mentioned) The complete source code for the images processing and statistical analysis, patch size data, and the figures with each fit is available at figshare <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.XXXXX>.  ## ResultsThe power law distribution was selected as the best model in most [](SRD Suggest mention the percent of cases with power law as best model?) of the cases (Supplementary Figure S7). In a small number of cases (4 out of 300), the power law with exponential cutoff was selected, but the value of the parameter $\alpha$ was similar by $\pm 0.02$ to the pure power law. Since, in addition, the patch size where the exponential tail begins is very large, we used the power law parameters for this cases (See Supplementary data, region EUAS3). [](SRD The following may be better suit for discussion I think) In finite-size systems the favored model should be the power law with exponential cutoff, because the power-law tails are truncated to the size of the system [@Stauffer1994]. Here the study areas are so large that the cutoff is practically not observed.There is only one forest region that does not follow a power law: Eurasia mainland, which follows a log-normal distribution. The log-normal and power law are both heavy tailed distributions and difficult to distinguish, but in this case Akaike weights have very high values for log-normal (near 1), meaning that this is the only possible model. In addition, the goodness of fit tests clearly rejected the power law model in all cases for this region (Supplementary table S1, region EUAS1). In general, the goodness of fit test rejected the power law model in fewer than 10% of cases. In large forest areas like Africa mainland (AF1) or South America tropical-subtropical (SAST1), larger deviations are expected and the rejections rates are higher so the proportion is 30% or less (Supplementary Table S1).Taking into account the bootstrapped confidence intervals of each power law exponent ($\alpha$), and the temporal autocorrelation, there were no significant differences between $\alpha$ for the regions with the biggest forest areas (greater than $10^{7}$ \si{km^2}) (Figure 1 and Supplementary figure S8). There was also no difference between these regions and smaller ones (Supplementary Table S2 & S3), and all the slopes of $\alpha$ are not different from 0 (Supplementary Table S3). This implies a global average $\alpha=1.908$, with a bootstrapped 95% confidence interval between 1.898 and 1.920.![Power law exponents ($\alpha$) of forest patch distributions for regions with total forest area $> 10^{7}$ \si{km^2}.

South America tropical and subtropical (SAST1) and North America (NA1) have a higher $RS_{max}$ of more than 60%, and other big regions 40% or less. For regions with less total forest area (Supplementary figure S9 & Table 1), the United Kingdom (EUAS3) has a very low proportion near 1%, while other regions such as New Guinea (OC2) and Malaysia/Kalimantan (OC3) have a very high proportion. SEAS2 (Philippines) is a very interesting case because it seems to be under 30% until the year 2005, fluctuates in the range 30-60%, and then stays over 60% (supplementary figure S9). [](SRD Next phrase seems better suited for discussion; the "very interesting" in previous sentence also feels discussion-like, suggest modify with "is a particular case") This seems to be an example of a transition from an unconnected to connected state, and deserves further in-depth study. ![Largest patch proportion relative to total forest area $RS_{max}$, for regions with total forest area $>10^{7}$ \si{km^2}.

The distribution of fluctuations of the largest patch relative to total forest area $\Delta RS_{max}$ showed differences between regions instead: most cases followed a power law distribution, but Eurasia mainland (EUAS1), New Guinea (OC2), Malaysia (OC3), New Zealand (OC6, OC8) and Java (OC7) followed an exponential distribution (Supplementary Table S7). The goodness of fit test (GOF) did not reject power laws in any case for both $\Delta S_{max}$ and $\Delta RS_{max}$, but nor could it reject the other models except in a few cases, which was expected due to the small number of observations. We only considered fluctuations to follow a power law when this distribution was selected for both absolute and relative fluctuations. [](SRD I modified a bit the text of this paragraph, please check it retained the correct meaning.)[](SRD Suggestion to open the paragraph: "A trend was observed between $RS_{max}$ of the forest regions and whether the largest patch remained the same throughout the whole study time period." A new figure of RS_{max} vs. probability of change of largest patch for the 3 ranges < 30, 30-40, and > 40% could aid in the understanding of this results) If the largest patch is always the same patch over time, the forest is probably not fragmented; the animations of the two largest patches (Supplementary data) for each region qualitatively shows the nature of fluctuations and if the state of the forest is connected or not. The largest patch remained the same in all regions [](SRD it this correct?) with $RS_{max}$ of more than 40%, such as Madagascar (AF2), North America (NA1), and Malaysia (OC3). For these regions, the largest patch could thus represent a core area for conservation. [TODO: I'd move previous sentence to discussion, SRD I agree, and it's very interesting: an old point revisited with a new approach] In regions with $RS_{max}$ between 30% to 40% forest cover, the identity of the largest patch remained constant in some cases, but changed in others. In Java (OC7), the largest patch changed, and for mainland Africa (AF1) it stayed the same, as this is the zone where the critical transition occurs [](SRD It is not easy to see whether this are examples or the only regions with with $RS_{max}$ between 30% to 40%). Only for mainland Eurasia (EUAS1) we observed that the two patches largest patches were always the same, implying that this region is probably composed of two independent domains and should be divided in further studies [](SRD Discussion?). In all the regions with $RS_{max}$ less than 30%, the largest patch changed over time, e.g. Cuba (SAST2) and United Kingdom(EUAS3), reflecting their fragmented state. In the case of Philippines (SEAS2), in particular, a transition was observed, with the identity of the largest patch being variable at first, and then constant after 2010. The results of quantile regressions are identical for $\Delta RS_{max}$ and $\Delta S_{max}$ (Supplementary Table S4). Among the biggest regions, Africa (AF1) has upper and lower quantiles with significantly negative slopes, [](SRD Rest of the phrasing not clear for me) but the lower quantile slope is lower, implying that negative fluctuations and variance are increasing (Figure 3). In the case of Mainland Eurasia (EUAS1), only the upper quantile has a significant, positive slope, suggesting an increase in variance. Mainland North America (NA1) exhibits a significant lower quantile with a positive slope, implying a decreasing variance. Finally, for mainland Australia, all quantiles are significant, and the slope of the lower quantiles is greater than the upper ones, showing variance is decreasing (Supplementary Figure S10). These results are summarized in Table 1.   The conditions that indicate that a region is near a critical fragmentation threshold are that patch size distributions follow a power law; temporal $\Delta RS_{max}$ fluctuations follow a power law; variance of $\Delta RS_{max}$ is increasing in time; and skewness is negative.

These include tropical rainforest, boreal and temperate forest. Power laws have previously been found for several kinds of vegetation, but never at global scales as in this study. Interestingly, Eurasia does not follow a power law, but it is a geographically extended region, consisting of different domains (as we observed in the Supplementary Information animations). It is known that the union of two independent power law distributions produces a lognormal distribution [@VanRooij2013]. Future studies should split this region into two or more new regions, and test if the underlying distributions are power laws. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the emergence of power laws in natural systems [](SRD I added "natural systems", but reading afterward I doubt if you are referring to forests in particular): the first is related with self organized criticality (SOC), when the system is driven by its internal dynamics to a critical state; this has been suggested mainly for fire-driven forests [@Zinck2009; @Hantson2015]. Real ecosystems do not seem to meet the requirements of SOC dynamics: their dynamics are influenced by external forces, and interactions are non-homogeneous (i.e. vary from place to place) [@Sole2002a]. Moreover, SOC in forest-fire dynamics requires a memory effect: fire scars in a site should accumulate and interfere with the propagation of a new fire. Pueyo et al. [-@Pueyo2010] did not find any such effect [](SRD Studying what system?), and suggest that other mechanisms produce the observed power law patterns. Other studies also found that SOC models did not reproduce the patterns of observed fires. SOC models produce power law exponents with $\alpha=1.16$, a much lower value than the confidence interval we found for the global average of $\alpha$ (1.898--1.920). Thus a mechanism which resembled SOC i.e. with a double separation of scales [](SRD I don't understand this), is not a plausible explanation for the global forest dynamics.The mechanism suggested by Pueyo et al. [-@Pueyo2010] is isotropic percolation: when a system is near the critical point, power law structures arises [](SRD Only near the critical point?). This is equivalent to the random forest model that we explained previously, and requires the tuning of an external environmental condition to carry the system to this point. We did not expect forest growth to be a random process at local scales, but it is possible that combinations of factors cancel out to produce seemingly random forest dynamics at large scales. If this is the case the power law exponent should be theoretically near $\alpha=2.05495$, but this value is outside the confidence interval we observed, and thus other explanations are needed. Another mechanism suggested as the cause of pervasive power laws in patch size distribution is facilitation [@Manor2008a;@Irvine2016]: a patch surrounded by forest will have a smaller probability of been deforested or degraded than an isolated patch. We hypothesize that models that include facilitation could explain the patterns observed here. The model of Scanlon et al. [-@Scanlon2007] represented the dynamics of savanna trees includes a global constraint (mean rainfall), a local facilitation mechanism, and two states (tree/non-tree), producing power laws across a rainfall gradient without the need for tuning an external parameter. The results for this model showed an $\alpha=1.34$ which is also different from our results. Another model, but with three states (tree/non-tree/degraded) and including local facilitation and grazing, was also used to obtain power laws patch distributions without external tuning, and exhibited deviations from power laws at high grazing pressures [@Kefi2007b]. The values of the power law exponent $\alpha$ obtained for this model are dependent on the intensity of facilitation: when facilitation is more intense the exponent is higher, yet the maximal values they obtained are still lower than the ones we observed. The interesting point is that the value of the exponent is dependent on the parameters, thus the observed $\alpha$ might be obtained with some parameter combination. Kefi et al. [-@Kefi2007b] proposed that a deviation in power law behavior with the form of an exponential decay or cut-off could be a signal of a critical transition. At the continental scales studied here, we did not observe exponential cut-offs, but we observed other signals of a transition, this confirms [](SRD I don't see how it confirms, maybe suggests?) that different mechanisms could produce different spatial patterns near the transition and that early warnings based only on spatial patterns are not universal for all the systems [@Weerman2012;@Kefi2014]. It has been suggested that a combination of spatial and temporal indicators could more reliably detect critical transitions [@Kefi2014]. In this study, we combined five criteria to detect the closeness to a fragmentation threshold. Two of them were spatial: the forest patch size distribution, and the proportion of the largest patch relative to total forest area ($RS_{max}$). The other three were the distribution of temporal fluctuations in the largest patch size, the trend in the variance, and the skewness of the fluctuations. Each one of these is not a strong individual predictor, but their combination gives us an increased degree of confidence about the system being close to a critical transition. We found that only the tropical forest of Africa and South America met the five criteria, and thus seem to be near a critical fragmentation threshold. This means that the combined influence of human pressures and climate forcings might trigger all the undesired effects of fragmentation in these extended areas. A small but continuous increase in forest loss could produce a biodiversity collapse [@Sole2004c], and this threshold effect has been observed in different kind of models, experimental microcosms [@Starzomski2007], field studies [@Pardini2010;@Martensen2012] and food webs [@Martinson2012]. Of these two areas, Africa seems to be more affected, because the proportion of the largest patch relative to total forest area ($RS_{max}$) is near 30%, which could indicate that the transition is already started. Moreover, this region was estimated to be potentially bistable, with the possibility to completely transform into a savanna [@Staver2011]. The region of South America tropical forest has a $RS_{max}$ of more than 60% suggesting that the fragmentation transition is approaching but not yet started. [](SRD I think it is not clear reading this following paragraph whether the described effects of fragmentation are based on a certain model of forest dynamics, for example when mention the fragmentation threshold.) When habitat is reduced, species population will decline proportionally [](SRD What about non linear effects?); this can happen even when the habitat fragments retain connectivity. As habitat reduction continues, the critical threshold is approached and connectivity will have large fluctuations [@Brook2013]. This could trigger several synergistic effects: populations fluctuations and the possibility of extinctions will rise, increasing patch isolation and decreasing connectivity [@Brook2013]. This positive feedback mechanism will be enhanced when the fragmentation threshold is reached, resulting in the loss of most habitat specialist species at a landscape scale [@Pardini2010]. Some authors argue that since species have heterogeneous responses to habitat loss and fragmentation, and biotic dispersal is limited, the importance of thresholds is restricted to local scales or even that its existence is questionable [@Brook2013]. Fragmentation is by definition a local process, [](SRD but?) that at some point [](SRD can?) produces emergent phenomena over the entire landscape, even if the area considered is infinite [@Oborny2005]. In addition, after a region's fragmentation threshold connectivity decreases, there is still a large and internally well connected patch that can maintain sensitive species [@Martensen2012] [](SRD According to a model, or an empirical study?). If current dynamics continue, what is the time needed for these large patches to become fragmented? Would this pose a real danger of extinction to a myriad of sensitive species? If a forest is already in a fragmented state, a second critical transition could happen: the so-called desertification transition [@Corrado2014]. Considering the actual trends of habitat loss, and studying the dynamics of non-forest patches---instead of the forest patches as we did here---the risk of this kind of transition could be estimated. To improve the estimation of non-forest patches, other datasets such as the MODIS cropland probability could be incorporated [@Sexton2015]. The simple models proposed previously could also be used to estimate if these thresholds are likely to be continuous and reversible or discontinuous and irreversible, and the degree of protection (e.g. using the set-asides strategy [@Banks-Leite2014]) than would be necessary to stop this trend.  The effectiveness of landscape management is related to the degree of fragmentation, and the criteria to direct the efforts could be focusing on the regions that are near a transition [@Oborny2007]. Regions that are in an unconnected state require large efforts to recover a connected state, but regions that are near a transition could be easily pushed to a connected state; feedbacks due to facilitation mechanisms might help to maintain this state. [](SRD I really like this idea, I think this line of thought can only be reached with the framework used here, and therefore could be emphasized.)Crossing the fragmentation critical point in forests could have negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services [@Haddad2015], but it could also produce feedback loops at different levels of the biological hierarchy. This means that a critical transition produced at a continental scale could have effects at the level of communities, food webs, populations, phenotypes and genotypes [@Barnosky2012]. All these effects interact with climate change, thus there is a potential production of cascading effects that could lead to a global collapse.Therefore, even if critical thresholds are reached only in some forest regions at a continental scale, a cascading effect with global consequences could still be produced, and may contribute to reach a planetary tipping point [](SRD references of works on planetary tipping point?). The risk of such event will be higher if the dynamics of separate continental regions are coupled [@Lenton2013]. Using the time series obtained in this work, the coupling of the continental could be further investigated. It has been proposed that to assess the probability of a global scale shift, different small scale ecosystems should be studied in parallel [](SRD reference/s?). [](SRD I'm not sure I follow ideas on the next sentence. Do you mean that major forests could drive a transition in smaller scales and then reach a global tipping point? If so, causality should be addressed, since one thing is to predict a critical transition by studying in parallel, and another to establish causality between what happens at small scale systems to reach a global transition, or a necessary condition for this to occur.) As forests comprises a major proportion of ecosystems, we think that a transition in major forests of the planet could drive smaller scale ones, and thus it could be used as a proxy for all the underling changes and a successful predictor of a planetary tipping point. ## References
