The fragmentation of forest is a global problem, produced mainly by anthropogenic activities, like the replacement of forest by agricultural or urban areas. 

This can trigger species extinctions and degradation of ecosystems services between other undesired effects. The level of fragmentation have thresholds, called critical points, that when surpassed can produce an increased rate of negative effects, that may be unnoticed before the critical point. 

The figure shows a critical fragmentation of a forest model. The sites occupied by forest are in green and the largest patch is in black, unoccupied sites are in white. In the panel (a) of forest is 0.8, lowers to 0.58 in (b) and to 0.48 in (c). The geometry of the largest patch changes radically around the critical point at 0.6 density and this could be used to detect the critical fragmentation thresholds in forest around the globe.
