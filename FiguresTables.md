## Figures and tables

![Forest patch distributions for continental regions for the years 2000 and 2014. The images are the 200 biggest patches, shown at a coarse pixel scale of 2.5 km.  The regions are: a) & b) southeast Asia; c) & d) South America subtropical and tropical and  e) & f) Africa mainland, for the years 2000 and 2014 respectively. The color palette was chosen to discriminate different patches and does not represent patch size.](figure/top200_patch_continent.png)

![Power law exponents ($\alpha$) of forest patch distributions for regions with total forest area $> 10^{7}$ \si{km^2}. Dashed horizontal lines are the means by region, with 95% confidence interval error bars estimated by bootstrap resampling. The regions are AF1: Africa mainland, EUAS1: Eurasia mainland, NA1: North America mainland, SAST1: South America subtropical and tropical, SEAS1: Southeast Asia mainland.](figure/PowerExp_gt10e7_year.png)

![Largest patch proportion relative to total forest area $RS_{max}$, for regions with total forest area $>10^{7}$ \si{km^2}. We show here the $RS_{max}$ calculated using a threshold of 40% of forest in each pixel to determine patches. Dashed lines are averages across time. The regions are AF1: Africa mainland, EUAS1: Eurasia mainland, NA1: North America mainland, SAST1: South America tropical and subtropical, SEAS1: Southeast Asia mainland.](figure/RSmax_gt1e7_ByYearThreshold_facet.png)

![Largest patch fluctuations for regions with total forest area $>10^{7} \si{km^2}$ across years. The patch sizes are relative to the total forest area of the same year. Dashed lines are 90% and 10% quantile regressions, to show if fluctuations were increasing; purple (dark) panels have significant slopes. The regions are AF1: Africa mainland, EUAS1: Eurasia mainland, NA1: North America mainland, SAST1: South America tropical and subtropical, SEAS1: Southeast Asia mainland.](figure/DeltaRSmax_yearThreshold_gt1e07.png)

Table: Regions and indicators of closeness to a critical fragmentation point. Where: $RS_{max}$ is the largest patch divided by the total forest area; Threshold is the value used to calculate patches from the MODIS VCF pixels; $\Delta RS_{max}$ are the fluctuations of $RS_{max}$ around the mean and the increase or decrease in the variance was estimated using quantile regressions; skewness was calculated for $RS_{max}$. NS means the results were non-significant. The conditions that determine the closeness to a fragmentation point are: increasing variance of $\Delta RS_{max}$ and negative skewness.  $RS_{max}$ indicates if the forest is unfragmented (>0.6) or fragmented (<0.3).
